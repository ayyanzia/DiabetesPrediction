# DiabetesPrediction
This project aims to predict diabetes using K-means and  Decision Tree Classifier. 
It starts by loading and preparing a dataset of health indicators. Key health features are selected, and a clustering technique is applied to add more insights. The data is then split to train a Decision Tree model, which learns patterns from the health features. Finally, the model's performance is evaluated, and the trained model is saved for future use.
